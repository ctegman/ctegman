Hi, I’m @ctegman.
I’m interested in teaching myself how to code with the goal of landing a job by the end of 2022 in front end web design, unless
I learn something along the way that I would rather pursue. I’m currently learning Responsive Web Design on freeCodeCamp, and
plan to finish the course in its entirety. Once finished, I'll start building personal projects to gain experience and practice new techniques;
all while continuing to find the next step in my learning process.
